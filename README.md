# Library-recomender
This System identifies and compares two library integrated softwares (Koha-Opac &amp; mylibrary) using users feedback. Feeback was scraped from Google play store for two apps and used as our datasets. Data Visualization was implemented with word cloud and we got the subjectivity and polarity of the reviews.
